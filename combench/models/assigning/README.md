# GeneralAssigning Model


## Overview

The GeneralAssigning class is a Python implementation of a general assignment problem. This problem involves assigning a set of tasks to a set of agents in a way that maximizes total profit while adhering to budget constraints. Each task-agent pair has an associated cost and profit, and the goal is to find an optimal assignment that balances these objectives and doesn't exceed any agent's budget.


## Problem Description

In the general assignment problem, you have:

	•	A number of agents.
	•	A number of tasks.
	•	A cost matrix where each element represents the cost of assigning a specific task to a specific agent.
	•	A profit matrix where each element represents the profit of assigning a specific task to a specific agent.
	•	A budget array where each element represents the maximum allowable cost for each agent.

The objective is to maximize the total profit from assigning tasks to agents while ensuring that the total cost for each agent does not exceed their respective budget.


## Design Encoding Scheme

The design is encoded as a binary vector assigning agents to tasks (assigning pattern). The length of the vector is equal to the number of agents multiplied by the number of tasks. 


## Objectives

The primary objectives are:

	1.	Maximize Total Profit: Sum of profits for all assigned task-agent pairs.
	2.	Respect Budget Constraints: Ensure that the total cost for each agent does not exceed their budget.


## Real-Life Example

Consider a project management scenario where a company needs to assign five different tasks to five available workers. Each worker can do multiple tasks, and each assignment incurs a certain cost and yields a certain profit. The company wants to maximize its profit from these assignments while ensuring that no worker’s total workload exceeds their available budget.
